# Code Test
This code test is designed to assess candidates' proficiency with common DevOps tools. It will evaluate your ability to perform tasks such as forking a repository, modifying source code, testing changes, and merging them into your repository. The test involves a simple C# Console application, which, when executed, will run various functions against test data and display the results. A unit test project is provided but not mandatory.
## Step 1
- Create a fork of the repository in your own GitHub account.
- Consider making your copy of the repository private so other's can't find it.
## Step 2
- Modify the code in CodeTest/Tester.cs to complete the four functions. Refer to comments within each function for input and output details.
## Step 3
- Merge your changes back into the repository in your GitHub account.
## Step 4
- Once satisfied, send an email to nickjm at uky.edu with the link to your GitHub repository.
- Ensure that you grant my GitHub account access to the repository, allowing me to download and review your code.
- Be prepared to discuss your code and explain your decisions.
