# Code Test
This code test is used to gauge candidatesâ€™ ability with some of the common tools used by the DevOps team. The test requires that you have a GitHub account and can perform common tasks like creating a fork of an existing repository, modifying source code, testing changes, and checking the changes back in to your repository.
The application is a simple C# Console application. When executed the program will run each function against a set of test data and print the results. A unit test project is also included and can be used during your work but is not required.
## Step 1
Create a fork of the repository in your own GitHub account.
## Step 2
Using your copy of the repository, update the code in CodeTest/Tester.cs to complete the four functions. Comments on each function describe the inputs and output for each function.
## Step 3
Merge your changes back into the repository in your GitHub account.
## Step 4
When you are satisfied send an email to me with the link to your GitHub repo. Make sure to give my GitHub account access to repository so I can download and execute the code.
It is important that you are able to discuss your code and explain your choices.
